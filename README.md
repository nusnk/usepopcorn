# Movie Search App 🎬

Welcome to the **Movie Search App**! This project was created while learning React through a Udemy course. It allows users to search for movies using an API and view essential details about them. The app is designed with a user-friendly interface and will be deployed on **Netlify** as part of my portfolio. 🚀

I built this project while learning **useEffect** behavior in React, understanding how to fetch and manage API data efficiently.
